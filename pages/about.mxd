My name is Luke and I'm a developer based in Kent, UK. I work as a Software Engineer for [Holiday Extras](http://www.holidayextras.co.uk) in Newingreen. I'm originally from North Yorkshire and I enjoy the great outdoors.

I set up this website as a) a bit of an experiment with loading different content types with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and displaying them with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and b) to log all my thoughts and travels. I intend this to be a bit of a life log regarding all things, but it will mostly come down to programming or walking for the most part.
