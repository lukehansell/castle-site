So after trying for some time to publish my blog with gh-pages I decided to fall back on my old faithful [Surge](http://surge.sh). I was trying to follow guidance on how to [publish a directory to your `gh-pages` branch](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490), but after fighting with it and my DNS for some time I gave up. I have no time when I'm working on personal projects to struggle with tools, especially since I have a good set that I know works.

Hence I fell back onto Surge. I ran `surge public` via an npm script that also built the package before deploying. Surge automatically picked up the CNAME file with my custom domain in that I was trying to use on Github and my blog was published in seconds. 

Surge is my kinda tool, easy and does exactly what it says on the in.
